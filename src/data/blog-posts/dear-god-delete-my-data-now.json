Is there a god? where he is? Seriously.. where are you?\n\nAh.. I get it.. You are everything and everyone. Aren't you? No? \n\nWell..... I DO NOT CARE.. \n\nI want to know why? \n\nI am more fortunate than many many animals.. But I am also less fortunate than some!\n\nBut why? \n\nDo you care about us? No wait... What I really mean is.. Do you care about me? Do you? DO YOU??\n\nEither way, Why? \n\nTo go school? To steal my innocence and then point your finger at me and say \"That's who you really are\"? Oh, am I not innocent in the first place? Then what I am in the first place?\n\nLife is an adventure, ha? Why am I part of your silly adventure. Oh I see.. My consent to participate is not needed? How is this even possible? \n\nWhen I am designing a scientific experiment that involves a survey or data collection of any sort. I must get the consent of every participant. DID YOU GET MY CONSENT? Let me be clear.. NO, I DID NOT AND I DO NOT CONSENT TO THIS. \n\nDELETE MY DATA AND REMOVE MY SELF FROM THIS SILLY GAME RIGHT NOW.. RIGHT NOW... RIGHT NOW.. \n\nOn the day of judgement, I shall hold you accountable, for everything that happened to me, but more importantly, for everything that I committed. You better be prepared!"
