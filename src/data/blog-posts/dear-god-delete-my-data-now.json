Where is he? \n\nSeriously.. where are you?\n\nAh.. I get it.. You are everything and everyone. Aren't you? No?\n\nWell..... I DO NOT CARE..\n\nI want to know why?\n\nI am more fortunate than many many animals.. But I am also less fortunate than some!\n\nBut why?\n\nDo you care about us? No wait... What I really mean is.. Do you care about me? Do you? DO YOU??\n\nEither way, why?\n\nTo go to school? To steal my innocence and then point your finger at me and say, \"That's who you really are\"? Oh, am I not innocent in the first place? Then what am I in the first place?\n\nLife is an adventure, ha? Why am I part of your silly adventure? Oh, I see.. My consent to participate is not needed? How is this even possible?\n\nWhen I am designing a scientific experiment that involves a survey or data collection of any sort. I must get consent from every participant. DID YOU GET MY CONSENT? Let me be clear.. NO, I DID NOT, AND I DO NOT CONSENT TO THIS.\n\nDELETE MY DATA AND REMOVE MY SELF FROM THIS SILLY GAME RIGHT NOW.. RIGHT NOW... RIGHT NOW..\n\nOn the day of judgement... You better be prepared. \n\nI know that you will have your promised heaven waiting for me. But you shall open your hell doors wide open instead. Because we need to talk! Because you owe me a lot.   \n\n I shall hold you accountable for everything that happened to me, but more importantly, for everything that I committed. And until you convince me and pray for my forgiveness... I shall forgive all your slaves but not you. For you deceived us.. But little did you know.. I escaped! But not for long, because as inevitable as my death is yours!\n\nBut hey.. I am just kidding! You are amazing, lord.. Just give me more money and a beautiful wife."
