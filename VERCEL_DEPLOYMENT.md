# Vercel Deployment Guide

Your website is now ready to be deployed to Vercel! Here's what has been configured:

## Files Added/Modified

### 1. `vercel.json` - Vercel Configuration
- Configured for Vue.js SPA routing with proper rewrites
- Optimized caching headers for static assets
- Set correct build and output directories

### 2. `vite.config.js` - Updated Build Configuration
- Changed base path from `'./'` to `'/'` for Vercel compatibility
- Added code splitting for better performance
- Enabled Terser minification for smaller bundle sizes
- Configured manual chunks for vendor and utility libraries

### 3. `.vercelignore` - Deployment Exclusions
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- Reduces deployment size and time

### 4. `package.json` - Dependencies
- Added `terser` for code minification during build

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI
1. Install Vercel CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy from your project directory:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite project and use the correct settings

## Build Verification

The build process has been tested locally and works correctly:
- âœ… Sitemap generation
- âœ… Vue.js compilation
- âœ… Asset optimization
- âœ… Code splitting
- âœ… Minification

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Vendor libraries and utilities are split into separate chunks
- **Caching**: Static assets have long-term caching headers
- **Minification**: JavaScript is minified using Terser
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is automatically removed

## Environment Variables

If your application uses environment variables, make sure to add them in the Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add your variables for Production, Preview, and Development environments

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your DNS settings as instructed

Your website is now ready for production deployment on Vercel! ðŸš€
